The following CSS code snippet might cause unexpected behavior in some browsers due to a specific order of selectors and the use of the `!important` flag:

```css
.container {
  width: 500px;
}

.item {
  width: 200px !important;
}

.container .item {
  width: 100px;
}
```

The `!important` flag on `.item` overrides the `width: 100px` in `.container .item`. However, the order of selectors can influence how this override works in specific situations.  In some cases, the browser might process the styles from more specific selectors first and then apply `!important` causing unpredictable results.

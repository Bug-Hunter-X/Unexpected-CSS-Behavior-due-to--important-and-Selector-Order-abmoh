The following revised CSS avoids the `!important` declaration, improving maintainability and readability:

```css
.container {
  width: 500px;
}

.container .item {
  width: 100px;
}

.item {
  width: 200px; /* No !important */
}
```

In this solution, the more specific selector `.container .item` takes precedence, resulting in the expected width of 100px for items inside the container.  The `.item` rule is still applied to items not within a `.container`, allowing for more flexible styling.
